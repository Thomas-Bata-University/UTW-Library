# UTW Template Data

**UTW Template Data** is a runtime Unity package that defines shared data structures used in UTW-based template systems, including tank components such as hulls, weapons, and suspension parts.

This package is designed to be referenced by both editor tools and runtime systems (e.g. when loading prefabs from AssetBundles).
